            <h3>Summary of Me</h3>
            <p>
              Hello! My name is Ravindu Rajatheva and I am a frontend developer.
              I am eager to work within the technology sector in Finland. I
              began my coding journey when I enrolled in one specific course
              called programming in C#. This was during my bachelor's degree in
              Business Administration from Oulu University of Applied Sciences.
              Hungry to learn more I applied to a master's degree in Computer
              Science at Aalto University.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my time at university I was able to land several roles.
              These include junior researcher position all the way up to working
              as a frontend developer in Nokia, Espoo. In my career I have
              learned more in depth about frontend development and how much I
              have still left to learn.
            </p>

            <h3>Why should you hire me?</h3>
            <p>
              My greatest strengths that I can offer to any company is that I am
              someone that is good at supporting others to reach a common goal.
              I make sure to spend time and ask questions to understand the
              business case or project I am involved in. Lastly, I am quick to
              absorb new information so that I am able to complete tasks and
              fulfill my duties. Below are a list of accomplistments I am proud
              to share.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Designed and developed frontend features that enhanced user
                experience and exceeded stakeholder/client requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                Made a major contribution in replacing manual test cases with
                automated testing scripts using Microsoft Playwright. This
                switch to test automation led to a reduction of nearly 90% in
                testing duration.
              </li>
              <li>
                Resolved an IT infrastructure limitation that blocked automated
                tests from executing by configuring Playwright testing
                parameters
              </li>
              <li>
                Used HTML canvas and RGB mapping for visualizing large datasets
                on webpages
