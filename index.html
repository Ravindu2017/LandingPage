            <h3>Summary of Me</h3>
            <p>
              Hello! My name is Ravindu Rajatheva, and I am a frontend developer.
              I am eager to work in the technology sector in Finland. I
              began my coding journey when I enrolled in a course
              called programming in C# during my bachelor's degree in
              Business Administration at Oulu University of Applied Sciences.
              Hungry to learn more, I applied and got accepted into a master's
              degree programme in Computer Science at Aalto University.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my time at university, I was able to land several roles,
              ranging from a junior researcher position all the way up to working
              as a frontend developer at Nokia, Espoo. In my career, I have gained
              a deeper understanding of frontend development and realized how much
              there is still left to learn.
            </p>

            <h3>Why should you hire me?</h3>
            <p>
              My greatest strength that I can offer to any company is my ability
              to support others to reach a common goal. I make sure to spend time
              asking the right questions to comprehend the business case or project
              I am involved in. Lastly, I am quick to absorb new information so
              that I am able to complete tasks and fulfill my duties. Below is
              a list of accomplishments I am proud to share.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Designed and developed frontend features that enhanced user
                experience and exceeded stakeholder and client requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                Made a major contribution to replacing manual test cases with
                automated testing scripts using Microsoft Playwright. This
                switch to test automation reduced testing duration by almost 90%.
              </li>
              <li>
                Resolved an IT infrastructure limitation that blocked automated
                tests from executing by configuring Playwright testing
                parameters
              </li>
              <li>
                Used HTML Canvas and RGB mapping to visualize large datasets
                on webpages
              </li>
